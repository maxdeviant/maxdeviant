### Greetings, traveler

Out of all the places you could be on the internet, you have happened upon my GitHub profile. Whether this was happenstance or purposeful, I hope you enjoy your stay all the same.

Feel free to peruse my projects. You may find something that you find useful or that inspires you to build.

My online home is my [personal website](https://maxdeviant.com), so check it out to learn more about me.

If you're interested in working together, check out my [résumé](https://maxdeviant.com/resume).
